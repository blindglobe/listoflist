;;; Purpose:    Manipulating structures which are lists of lists
;;;             rather than arrays or matrix-likes.  Providing an
;;;             xarray interface to these structures

;;; What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
;;; 'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

(in-package :listoflist)

;;; LISTOFLIST is another useful xrefable object.  The interface does
;;; NOT map to CL functions in a straightforward manner, unlike
;;; arrays.  So it makes a good example of a non-standard underlying
;;; data structure that we'd like for XARRAY.

;;; Thoughts for organization: there are 2 general flavors of
;;; activities.  The first is that we do list-of-list to list-of-list
;;; transforms, and these do not rely on external packages being in
;;; existence.  The second is that we do transformations from them
;;; into other similar rectangular or ragged data structures.
;;; Within-structure should include item-selection and subsetting,
;;; while between-structure should include copying and ideally,
;;; "pass-through" referential structures.  The latter is probably
;;; going to take a performance hit, but should allow for maximal
;;; memory use.

;; Currently, we assume that the list-of-list representation is in
;; row-major form, i.e. that lists represent rows and not columns.
;; The original lisp-stat had the other way around.  We could augment
;; the top-level list with a property to check orientation
;; (row-major/column-major), but this hasn't been done yet.
