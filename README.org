* Overview 

  The LISTOFLIST package (depends on xarray) contains functions and
  methods for handling list-of-lists as array substitutes as well as
  conversions between the two data structures.  The general API is
  that of XARRAY, but we have added a few convenience functions, as
  well. 

  This is part of the core suite of Common Lisp Statistics System
  (CLS) packages.


* Tasks to do

Originally the following was in the TODO.lisp file.

;;; Purpose:    development support and short-term memory. 

;;; What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
;;; 'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

;;; This organization and structure is new to the 21st Century
;;; version..   Think, "21st Century Schizoid Man".
